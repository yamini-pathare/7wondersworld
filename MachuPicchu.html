        Can you imagine the astonishment of those who discovered this metropolis, seemingly floating on clouds between mountains? The Machu Picchu, perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is a stone's throw from Cuzco. Although it was well known to the local people, the West took note of it in 1911 when it was spotted by the American explorer Hiram Bingham. It was initially believed to be Vilcabamba, a hidden Incan haven during the Spanish resistance. The genuine intent behind this 15th-century structure, however, remains debated, with suggestions that it served as a sanctuary for the revered 'Virgins of the Sun,' a place of worship, or perhaps a regal escape. Notwithstanding its remote and towering position, travelers can step back in time amidst meticulously preserved Incan edifices showcasing farming terraces, open squares, living quarters, and skillfully designed shrines. 
        Erected around 1450 as an imperial commission under Inca ruler Pachacuti, the site mesmerizes onlookers with its smooth, dry-stone construction and breathtaking vistas of the encompassing valley.
