    <h1>
        The Great Wall Of China - China, Built In 700 BCE
    </h1>

        A creation that serves as one of the largest archives of historical documents and a morgue, the Great Wall of China has gone far beyond its original purpose as just a defensive measure. Let's unpack that: because it was in construction for nearly 2,000 years by separate dynasties, inscriptions, and corpses are carved and buried onto and into this megalithic icon. 
        Furthermore, tourist hype forced Chinese authorities to implement a daily limit of 65,000 visitors in places like the Badaling section of the Great Wall. It is hard to estimate the total annual visitors due to it being 5,500 miles (8,851 km) long, but around 150 million inbound tourists visit Beijing each year, and travel bloggers frequently claim that almost all tourists visiting Beijing are planning to check out the wall.
