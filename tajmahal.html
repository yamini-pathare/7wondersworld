    The Taj Mahal welcomes an astonishing 35 to 40 thousand visitors every day â€” and with busy seasons, it is no stranger to up to 8 million visitors annually. The origin of this marbled expression of love lies in the celebrated reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan 400 years ago. This leader had a desire to build a monument to the object of his affection and favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Ultimately, it exists as a tomb for her, but she is certainly one of the few people who will not be forgotten as time goes by.

It took 20 thousand artisans to create this place, with precious jewels and marble that are said to gleam pink and white depending on the time of day. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site (since 1983), the architecture is a celebration of the Mughal style. One fascinating choice the designers made was to slightly tilt the four minarets (towers) away from the main structure so that in the case of disaster, they would not collapse towards the tomb and cause more damage. Bear in mind, if you take the pilgrimage there, that the complex also hosts a brilliant mosque and a guest house that are worthy of appreciation, too.
