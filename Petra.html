    <h1>Petra - Jordan, Built In 312 BCE
    </h1>
    <img src="4.webp">
    <p>"This is impossible" is a common thought for those who stand beneath the carved red-rock mountains in Petra. Yet, there it is. This ancient trading hub is larger than any painting or picture can capture, which is a reality that its one million annual visitors can understand. The buildings, sculpted straight out of the canyon walls, would have been endangered by sudden flash floods, but the Nabateans (a wealthy arab kingdom) designed a complex water control system to manage this. Due to the desert climate, they even installed an intricate series of dams, canals, and reservoirs into the rock faces to maintain a consistent water supply for 20,000 inhabitants. 
        Those grooves still exist in the rock walls today, collecting moisture the same way as they did two thousand years ago.</p>
