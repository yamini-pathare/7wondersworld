    <h1>Chichén Itzá - Mexico, Built In 600 CE</h1>

        This site is a golden example to prove that Egyptians were not the only ones capable of constructing enormous pyramids. The largest structure, El Castillo, is 98 feet and utilizes 365 stone steps to represent the solar year. The Maya people went beyond just sheer scale: during the equinoxes, a mystical shadow appears due to ingenious engineering, and a serpent's shadow appears to slither down the staircase. Naturally, this attention to detail means that the whole area was a religious, political, and economic center for the Mayan civilization that seems to have vanished overnight, abandoning all settlements by 900 CE. Stone tools were enough to create this 5 km2 complex, which is one of the reasons it fits as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Astronomy and acoustics were common sciences in this city, which is fitted with an ancient observatory, and whispers at one end of the Ball Court can be heard 135 meters away at the other end.
         Human sacrifices were performed here, but thankfully, its 3 million yearly visitors will not have to witness those extinct practices.
