    The Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro is an awe-inspiring symbol of both faith and architectural brilliance.
     Overlooking the city from atop Mount Corcovado, this religious icon is visited by almost 2 million people per year.
      Initiated in the period following World War I, its creation from 1926 to 1931 was a collective endeavor involving Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. 
      With a striking height of 98 feet and its arms reaching 92 feet wide, it's a marvel to behold. The base further elevates its grandeur by 26 feet. Made of reinforced concrete and embellished with over six million tiles, this statue is recognized as the world's most prominent Art Deco figure. Despite weather challenges, like lightning strikes, it remains steadfast, only once suffering damage to Jesus's right thumb in 2014. From almost any location in Rio, its silhouette can be discerned, providing incredible views and drawing both believers and admirers. 
    Its significance and beauty rightfully earn it a place among the world's most revered landmarks.
